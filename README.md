# Question: How do you implement a bloom filter for fast set membership checking? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code implements a Bloom filter, a data structure used for fast set membership checking. The BloomFilter class is initialized with a specified size (defaulting to 100) and an array of that size filled with boolean values. The class includes methods to add items to the filter and check if an item is in the filter. When an item is added, it is passed through two hash functions, which return indices for the storage array. The values at these indices are then set to true. When checking if an item is in the filter, the item is again passed through the hash functions, and the method checks if the values at the returned indices are true. If they are, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This implementation allows for fast membership checking but can result in false positives, as different items can potentially result in the same indices. However, it guarantees no false negatives, meaning if an item is in the set, the filter will correctly report it as such.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the Bloom filter is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and functionality. However, there are a few differences due to TypeScript's static typing and other features:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to ensure type safety. For example, the `size` property is explicitly declared as a number, the `storage` property is declared as a `Uint8Array`, and the `item` parameter in the `add` and `check` methods is declared as a string. The `getHashValues` method is declared to return an array of numbers.

2. Access Modifiers: TypeScript version uses access modifiers (`private`) to restrict the accessibility of the methods `getHashValues`, `hash1`, and `hash2`. These methods are not intended to be accessed outside of the class, so they are marked as private.

3. Uint8Array: Instead of using a regular JavaScript array filled with boolean values, the TypeScript version uses a `Uint8Array`. This is a typed array that uses less memory than a regular array, which can be beneficial for large Bloom filters.

4. Method Naming: The `contains` method in the JavaScript version is renamed to `check` in the TypeScript version. This doesn't change the functionality, but it might make the method's purpose clearer.

5. Hash Functions: The hash functions in the TypeScript version are slightly different from those in the JavaScript version, but they serve the same purpose of generating a hash value based on the input string. The differences in the hash functions do not affect the overall functionality of the Bloom filter.

6. Constructor Parameter: In the TypeScript version, the `size` parameter is required in the constructor, while in the JavaScript version, it is optional and defaults to 100 if not provided.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the Bloom filter is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall approach. Both versions use two hash functions to determine the indices in the storage array where an item should be stored or checked. The `add` method adds an item to the filter, and the `is_value` (or `contains` in JavaScript) method checks if an item is in the filter.

However, there are several differences due to the language features and methods used in each version:

1. Data Types: In JavaScript, the storage is an array of booleans, while in C++, a `bitset` is used. A `bitset` is a special container class in C++ Standard Library that is designed to store bits (elements with only two possible values: 0 or 1, true or false, ...).

2. Hash Functions: The hash functions in both versions are different. In JavaScript, the hash functions are based on bitwise operations and character codes. In C++, the first hash function is based on the character code modulo the filter length, and the second hash function is based on the sum of the character codes modulo the filter length.

3. String Processing: In JavaScript, strings are processed using built-in methods like `charCodeAt`. In C++, strings are processed as character arrays, and the ASCII value of each character is used directly.

4. Output: In JavaScript, the output is logged to the console using `console.log`. In C++, the output is printed to the standard output using `std::cout`.

5. Memory Management: In C++, the programmer has direct control over memory management. This is not the case in JavaScript, which has automatic garbage collection.

6. Syntax: The syntax of the two languages is different. For example, C++ uses `::` for scope resolution, while JavaScript uses `.` for property access. C++ uses pointers and addresses, which are not available in JavaScript. 

7. Function Names: The function to check if a value is in the filter is called `contains` in JavaScript and `is_value` in C++.
